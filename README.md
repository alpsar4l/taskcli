# TaskCLI

The purpose of this project is to satisfy my urge to write code before going to sleep due to my phone being out of charge. To explain the project, it allows you to check your to-do list from the console, works very quickly (quite fast), and provides access to almost everything.

First of all, Python needs to be installed on the system, and then:

```bash
# install
./install.sh

# then
tasks
```
